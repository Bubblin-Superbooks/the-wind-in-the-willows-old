    Saw the star o’er a stable low;
    Mary she might not further go—
     Welcome thatch, and litter below!
      Joy was hers in the morning!</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code>    And then they heard the angels tell
    ‘Who were the first to cry NOWELL?
    Animals all, as it befell,
     In the stable where they did dwell!
      Joy shall be theirs in the morning!’</code></pre></blockquote></div> </div>
